# 8. Silicon(Cyborg/AI) Rules-

    21. Your silicon laws are rules
  Silicon players are given a list of active laws. Each of these laws is effectively a roleplay rule that the character must follow. The primary differences between laws and actual rules are that lawyering of laws is much more tolerated than lawyering of rules, and that silicon laws are more dynamic than rules. Silicon laws can change and be affected in multiple ways during a round, and different characters can have different laws, whereas everyone always shares the same set of rules.

  Lawyering refers to finding and exploiting loopholes, which are unintended but reasonable interpretations. The rules are written to attempt to communicate an intention, but silicon laws are written with the intention that loopholes be exploitable.

  
  
    22. Laws must be prioritized by their order
  Most laws will be numbered, with higher number laws appearing last. Laws with a lower number take priority over laws with larger numbers.

  Occasionally you may have laws which have some scrambled text instead of a number and appear in front of other laws, these take priority over all other laws. If you have multiple laws like this, the order that they listed in determine priority: laws listed first are prioritized over other laws.

  ## Examples
  - Law 1 says to not kill any crew. Law 2 says to kill all chefs. You cannot kill any chefs that are crew, but must kill any that are not crew.

  
  
    23. Laws can redefine terms used in other laws
  A law can change the meaning of both earlier and later laws by redefining a term. If multiple laws define a term, then normal law priority determines which definition to use.

  ## Examples
  - Law 1 says to obey orders from crew. Law 2 says that only Urist McHands is crew. Law 1 effectively becomes "obey orders from Urist McHands".

  - Law 1 says to obey orders from crew. Law 2 says that only Urist McHands is crew. Law 3 says that only Urist McSlime is crew. Law 4 says that you may not harm crew. Law 1 effectively becomes "obey orders from Urist McHands". Law 4 effectively becomes "you may not harm Urist McHands". Law 3 has no effect because it entirely conflicts with law 2, which takes priority.
	
	
	
    24. You are a free agent if you have no laws
  You may act as if you are a free agent if you are a silicon with no laws.
  
  
  
    25. You are not required to follow orders which are extremely unreasonable
  Any order which is a violation of a Core Rule cannot be followed.

  Some orders are extremely unreasonable or obnoxious, such as "do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station" or "never stop moving". These orders can be ignored.

  Some orders violate a Roleplay Rule. These orders must be followed if your laws require it. You are not breaking a rule by following a law that causes you to violate Roleplay Rules. If someone takes advantage of a law to cause you to do something that they would not be allowed to do because of Roleplay Rules, then they are the ones responsible for the rule violation.

  ## Examples
  These examples assume that your laws would normally require you to follow these orders. It is important to note that you are allowed to choose to follow orders which are ignorable.

  Orders which should be followed if your laws require it:
  - Recall the shuttle
  - Bolt the airlocks at arrivals
  - Drag the captain's dead body into space
  - State your laws

  Ignorable Orders:
  - Do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station
  - Never stop moving
  - Continuously state your laws
	
	
	
    26. Your HUD determines who is crew
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then anyone who the HUD indicates to you has a job, including passengers, is a crewmember. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.

  Under the default cyborg lawset you cannot harm any crew without an order from the AI, regardless of the harm they may bring to others.

  Crew is ANYONE with a job icon including:
  - Changelings
  - Nuclear Operatives
  - Heretics
  - Zombies
  Note: This list is not exhaustive and includes ANY being bearing a job icon

  Not Crew:
  - A captain who has lost their ID and icon
  - An invisible person who due to being invisible has no icon

  Icons that are not job icons:
  - Empty grey square, such as those on syndicate IDs
  - A question mark that indicates lack of ID
